# btc-futures-bot
My btc futures trading bot. Live since 24 May 2020

Created as a hobby project during May 2020, this code is an application of my backtesting process, to see whether it scales to a live environment.
Therefore, the code itself is a bit messy. Live performance is consistent with backtest so far, predicting ~5% gains per month on average (on leverage).

Code is purely online as reference; no tuning parameters or auth tokens included, nor is it advised to run this code yourself with real money.
If you choose to recreate, you're on your own to figure those out ;)

Also included is some files to autorun on a Raspberry Pi (I'm running it on Arch Linux ARM, archlinuxarm.org)
As well as controlling an LCD display.

Most Raspberry Pi's should be able to run this, just make sure the internet connection is good.
